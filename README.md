I have made the app in Kotlin , the app is responsive to all screen sizes (i.e., mobile and tablets) .   



Concepts used:     

-> Used Retrofit to fetch data from API      
->Used Recycler View and ViewPager2 to show tabs for different fragments in a vertical style      
->Used Recycler View in showing fetched data from API in a scrollable format         
->Used FrameLayout for floating layouts ,RelativeLayout and LinearLayout for designing app
